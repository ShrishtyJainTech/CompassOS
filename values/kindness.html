    <h1>🌸 Kindness</h1>

      <h2>Why Kindness Matters to Me</h2>
      <p>Kindness is my anchor. It means showing up with gentleness in a world that often forgets to pause. I believe in the ripple effect of small acts—how a word or a smile at the right time can quietly change someone’s day.</p>
      
      <h2>My Commitments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Offer one intentional act of kindness daily (even a silent one)</li>
        <li>Practice kindness toward myself, especially when I fail</li>
        <li>Recognize kindness in others and reflect it back</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stories That Hold This Value</h2>
      <p>Coming soon: reflections and real-world examples where kindness shaped a moment or choice.</p>
