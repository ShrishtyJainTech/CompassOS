    <h1>✨ Purpose</h1>
    <p class="mantra">"The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away." — Pablo Picasso</p>

      <h2>Why Purpose Matters to Me</h2>
      <p>I want my life to echo beyond me—to know that how I show up matters. Purpose isn’t just about big dreams, but small choices rooted in meaning. It’s about living with direction, even when the path isn’t clear.</p>

      <h2>My Commitments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Align daily actions with values, not just urgency</li>
        <li>Reflect regularly on what feels meaningful</li>
        <li>Live with presence, not autopilot</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Purpose-Driven Days</h2>
      <p>Coming soon: Reflections on clarity, connection, and direction.</p>
