      <h2>Why Loyalty Matters to Me</h2>
      <p>Loyalty is my quiet power. It’s showing up not just in celebration, but in silence. To me, loyalty means being a safe place—for others and for myself—and honoring the bonds that truly matter.</p>

      <h2>My Commitments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Show up consistently for the people I value</li>
        <li>Stay true to my voice, even when it’s hard</li>
        <li>Remember: loyalty includes loyalty to myself</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Loyalty in Practice</h2>
